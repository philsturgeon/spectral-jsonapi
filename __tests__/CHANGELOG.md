# Changelog

All notable changes to this project will be documented in this file.

The format is based on [Keep a Changelog](https://keepachangelog.com/en/1.0.0/),
and this project adheres to [Semantic Versioning](https://semver.org/spec/v2.0.0.html).

## [Unreleased]

### Added
- Created TypeScript version of the ruleset. YAML still available.
- Test suite now fully tested with Jest.
- New rule `get-404-response-code` to make sure there's a 404 on any GET that can reasonably assumed to be a "single resource". This implementation looks for any URL parameter, so `/tickets` does not need a 404, but `/tickets/{id}` does.

### Changed
- Now supporting JSON:API v1.1 instead of v1.0, with updated documentation links.
- Content type may now start with `application/vnd.api+json` instead of matching entirely. This is to allow for `ext=` media type parameters, `charset=`, etc.

### Deprecated
- 

### Removed
- Rule `error-processing` has been removed as behavior did not match what the JSON:API spec was talking about.

### Fixed
- Rule `resource-object-id-required` will now look into an `allOf` to look for `id` instead of failing.
- Rules `relationships-object-type` and `resource-object-id-required` will work on the resolved version of the document to peek through `$ref`.
